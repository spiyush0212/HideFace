## HideFace
This chrome extension helps you to hide people's face while watching YouTube videos. Hence minimizing possible distractions.

## Features

* This extension provides a short black box that can be dragged anywhere on the screen to hide the tutor's face.  
* Simply click the red X button to close the extension  
* Currently the box is not resizeable, if you can fix that issue, that would be great!
